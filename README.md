# CS6190_Project

This repository contains the datasets, python scripts, and final report for the CS 6190 - Probabilistic Machine Learning semester project at The University of Utah.

PyTorch is required to run the python scripts, make sure it is installed before executing the scripts individually, or using the shell script to execute all at once.

To execute the shell script:

1: Open a Git Bash terminal

2: Using the cd command and the file path to the folder containing the scripts, change the current directory

3: Type "bash run.sh" into the Git Bash terminal and hit enter
